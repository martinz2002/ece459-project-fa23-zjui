  abstract = {Theory and experimental data are given which show the improvements in signal-noise ratio effected by frequency modulation over amplitude modulation. It is shown that above a certain carrier-noise ratio in the frequency modulation receiver which is called the "improvement threshold," the frequency modulation signal-noise ratio is greater than the amplitude modulation signal-noise ratio by a factor equal to the product of a constant and the deviation ratio (the deviation ratio is equal to the ratio between the maximum frequency deviation and the audio modulation band width). The constant depends upon the type of noise, being slightly greater for impulse than for fluctuation noise. In frequency modulation systems with high deviation ratios, a higher carrier level is required to reach the improvement threshold than is required in systems with low deviation ratios; this carrier level is higher for impulse than for fluctuation noise. At carrier-noise ratios below the improvement threshold, the peak signal-noise ratio characteristics of the frequency modulation receiver are approximately the same as those of the amplitude modulation receiver, but the energy content of the frequency modulation noise is reduced. An effect which is called "frequency limiting" is pointed out in which the peak value of the noise is limited to a value not greater than the peak value of the signal. With impulse noise this phenomenon effects a noise suppression in a manner similar to that in the recent circuits for reducing impulse noise which is stronger than the carrier in amplitude modulation reception.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a high order filter for the Butterworth filters up to 8 th and 9 th order. The higher order filters are formed by using the combination of second and third order filters. While designing the Band-Pass Butterworth filter, four parameters need to be specified such as Ap (dB attenuation in the pass band), As (dB attenuation in the stop band), fp (frequency at which Ap occurs) and fs (frequency at which As occurs). The design procedure involves two steps, the first step is to find the required order of the filter and the second step is to find the scale factor that must be applied to the normalized parameter values. The Band-Pass Butterworth filler is a combination between low pass and high pass For the low pass Butterworth filter, the value of a resistor that has been used are 100KΩ and the value of the capacitor is found by scaled inversely with the frequency and the selected resistor value. While for the high pass Butterworth filter, the value of a capacitor that has been used is 0.05µF and the resistor value is found by scaled inversely with the frequency and the selected resistor value. The Butterworth Band-Pass filler required to bypass certain band of interest while suppressing the frequency below and above than pass band. Two configurations design circuit was tested by using LTspice software.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comparative theoretical study of amplitude, phase, and frequency modulation. In the first part, the fundamental mathematical expressions for the three types of modulation are derived. They are expressed in three different forms: as amplitude equations, side band equations and modulation vector equations. The amplitude equations indicate the envelope of the radio-frequency directly. The side band equations refer to the number, amplitude, and phase of the side bands produced by modulation. In the modulation vector equations, corresponding side bands are combined in pairs to form a "modulation vector." This is a r-f magnitude, rotating with the angular velocity of the carrier and its amplitude is simultaneously being changed at an audio rate. The main results derived from a discussion of these equations are: In phase and frequency modulation an infinite number of side bands is produced. Amplitude modulation produces but one pair of side bands. In amplitude modulation the modulation vector, representing the first pair of side bands is in phase with the carrier. In phase and frequency modulation, it is 90 degrees out of phase with respect to the carrier. Frequency modulation is equivalent to a phase modulation in which the phase shift is inversely proportional to the audio frequency. By means of the modulation vector, a new vector diagram of the phase modulation is given. In the second part, amplitude modulation is considered in which undesired phase or frequency modulation or a combination of the two takes place simultaneously.},
